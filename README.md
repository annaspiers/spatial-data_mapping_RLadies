***From csv to slippy map: intro to spatial data in R***  
Working with spatial data can feel as finicky as caring for your favorite houseplant - your attempts to help are rejected despite following instructions, and you look longingly at friends' and colleagues' masterpieces (i.e., maps/plants). This talk will introduce spatial data broadly, and cover some of the basic workflows and troubleshooting steps in R. Specifically, we will work with vector data, focus on the `sp` and `sf` libraries, and produce an interactive map in R. Example data and code will be provided.
