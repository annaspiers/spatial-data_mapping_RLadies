    "    * First released on CRAN in 2005\n",
    "    * Offers functionality to create and modify vector data and grids\n",
    "    * Many (about 350) of R's spatial packages use `sp` as a dependency\n",
    "    * Made up of 'slots' that describe the spatial object: always a bounding box and coordinate reference system (CRS), but also attributes (e.g., name, soil type, replicate)\n",
    "    * Examples of `sp` object classes: `SpatialPoints`, `SpatialLines`, `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, and more\n",
    "    * To read in a shapefile: `read_OGR()`\n",
    "* `sf`\n",
    "    * Stands for 'Simple Features'\n",
    "    * First released on CRAN in 2016\n",
    "    * Implements the [WKT (well-known text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format standard\n",
    "    * Examples of `sf` object classes: `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, and more\n",
    "    * To read in a shapefile: `st_read()` - slightly faster than `read_OGR()`\n",
    "* Data are structured and conceptualized differently between `sp` and `sf`. Other spatial packages may have different formatting standards and class definitions, but many are built as wrappers around the backbone of `sp` and increasingly more `sf`."
